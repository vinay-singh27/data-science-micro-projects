# data-science-portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks & .py files( modularize codes).



## Contents(WIP)

- ### [ML Models with Mini Project](https://github.com/vinay-singh27/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Models%20with%20Mini%20Projects)

	- Focused on implementation of Machine Learning Models on sample data. The aim of these mini projects is to perform basic EDA on the data and implement the ML model to understand the fit and evaluate its performance 

	_Models & tools: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, kNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib,

- ### Machine Learning(ML) Micro Projects

	- [ML Micro Project - Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/vinay-singh27/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Micro%20Project%20-%20Diabetes%20Prediction): Predict whether a patient is diabetic or not using their medical data. Have trained a SVM model using "linear" kernel as a classifier. The code is modularized for deployment. 
	_Models & tools: Support Vector Machine, scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

	- [ML Micro Project - Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction](https://github.com/vinay-singh27/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Micro%20Project%20-%20Sonar%20Rock%20vs%20Mine%20Prediction): Trained a classifier on the SONAR data to predict whether the object is Rock or Mine. Have used a Logistic Regression model to train the model. The code is modularized for deployment. 

	- [ML Micro Project - House Price Prediction](https://github.com/vinay-singh27/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/ML%20Micro%20Project%20-%20House%20Price%20Prediction): Predict the price of the house using Boston House Price dataset. Have used LGBM model and implemented hyper-parameter tuning Optuna. The code is modularized for deployment.
